You can customize the colors used for the highlight by changing the

options dialog.

   extensions.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2010 and build it.
3. Close all open VS2010 instances.
4. Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the project's output folder and double
   click on the LineAdornments.vsix generated.

That's it!
